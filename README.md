# A Touch of Space: Shopify's Frontend Challenge 2022, authored by Kieran Dunch

The Shopify Frontend Challenge was a lot of fun to do! Here's a loft of features I built into the App:
- Responsive Design
- Designed with HTML Accessibility 
- Fetches directly from NASA's Picture of the Day API to display photographs and description directly in browser
- Loading state
- a 'like' button that can be liked and unliked!
- My personal favourite: The website will genereate new photos from thousands of photgraphs on every refresh of the page

Next Steps:
- I'm really looking to build users into the app, storing liked photos in a database so that users can save their favourite photos to view them later!
